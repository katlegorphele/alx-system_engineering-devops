Explanation of the infrastructure:

    A user enters www.foobar.com in their browser.
    A DNS resolver receives the request and queries a DNS server for the IP address associated with www.foobar.com.
    The DNS server responds with the IP address of our server, which is 8.8.8.8 in this case.
    The user's browser sends an HTTP request to our server at IP 8.8.8.8.
    The request is received by the web server, which in this case is Nginx.
    Nginx passes the request to the application server, which runs our code base.
    The application server processes the request and queries the MySQL database as needed.
    The database responds with the necessary information, and the application server returns a response to Nginx.
    Nginx sends the response back to the user's browser.

Issues:

    This infrastructure has a single point of failure (SPOF) because there is only one server. If that server goes down, the website will be unavailable.
    When maintenance is needed, such as deploying new code or updating the web server, the website will experience downtime.
    The infrastructure cannot handle large amounts of incoming traffic, which can lead to slow page loads or even crashes.
